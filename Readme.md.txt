## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ Percentage & Grading System
**File:** `1st project.py`  
- User enters obtained marks and total marks.  
- Program calculates percentage.  
- Shows grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F).  
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., marks > total).  

**Example Run:**

Enter obtained number : 450
Enter total numbers : 500
Percentage : 90.0 %
Your Grade is A+ 😁
